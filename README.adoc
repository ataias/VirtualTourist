= VirtualTourist

This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. The locations and photo albums are stored in Core Data. This app was made as part of the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.

== Running
To run this app, you need to set up the `Secrets.json` file first in the following format:

[source,json]
----
include::VirtualTourist/Secrets.json.example[]
----

The values the above json should be replaced by actual API keys. For that, please request API keys at https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/[Flickr].

Once you have the keys, you can bootstrap the secrets file with:

[source,bash]
----
cp VirtualTourist/Secrets.json.example VirtualTourist/Secrets.json
----

and then you can modify `Secrets.json` in place.

Once your credentials are set, you can use Xcode 12 or greater to start the app.
