= VirtualTourist

This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. The locations and photo albums are stored in Core Data. This app was made as part of the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.

== Running
To run this app, you need to set up the `Secrets.json` file first in the following format:

[source,json]
----
include::VirtualTourist/Secrets.json.example[]
----

The values the above json should be replaced by actual API keys. For that, please request API keys at https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/[Flickr].

Once you have the keys, you can bootstrap the secrets file with:

[source,bash]
----
cp VirtualTourist/Secrets.json.example VirtualTourist/Secrets.json
----

and then you can modify `Secrets.json` in place.

Once your credentials are set, you can use Xcode 12 or greater to start the app.

== Logging In

Once you open the app, you will face the login screen:

The login uses Flickr OAuth, so you will be taken to their website where you can login with your credentials. Once you authorize the app on your browser, you will be redirected to VirtualTourist and see the map view where you can drop pins:

== Work Notes

=== Authentication
This app does not really need authentication to work with the Flickr API. However, initially I found the endpoint https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.geo.photosForLocation.html[flickr.photos.geo.photosForLocation] and only after I got it working with authentication and all the Flickr API signing requirements that I noticed it worked only for the images of the authenticated Flickr user. The actual endpoint now used is https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html[flickr.photos.search] which does not require authentication for public photos.
